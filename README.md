Hi [Name],

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to inform you that my attendance for **6 January** has been marked as absent. I was present on that day and attended the session as scheduled.

I request your guidance on how this can be corrected. If required, the same can also be verified with the trainer. Please let me know if I should reach out to any other team or point of contact for this correction.

Thank you for your support.

Regards,
Shashank Kumar
