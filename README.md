Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m writing to follow up regarding my attendance for 6 January, which is currently marked as absent. I had reached out earlier on Teams as well, but I understand you may have been busy.

I was present on that day, and I wanted to request your guidance on how this can be rectified. You may also confirm my presence with the trainer if required.
If this needs to be handled by a different team or point of contact, kindly let me know so I can reach out accordingly.

Thank you for your time and support.

Regards,
Shashank Kumar
